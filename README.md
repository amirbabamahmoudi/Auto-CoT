# Auto-CoT

Auto-CoT is a research project that analyzes the effectiveness of various clustering methods for Automatic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation. In this work, we evaluate techniques such as:

- **DBSCAN**
- **K-medoids**
- **Agglomerative Clustering**
- **HDBSCAN**
- **OPTICS**
- **K-means**
- **Spectral**
  
to determine which approach best groups intermediate reasoning steps. Our experiments are conducted on datasets such as **MultiArith** and **AddSub**, with the goal of improving CoT results by selecting the optimal clustering strategy based on empirical performance. We conducted the experiments in two settings, zero-shot and few-shot leraning.
